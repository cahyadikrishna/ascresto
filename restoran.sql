Amino acids contained in green tea reduce the possibility of depression.\r\n\r\nAlthough green tea comes from the same tea plant as black tea, green tea leaves are less processed, so the color remains green and prevents the waste of many nutrients contained in it.\r\n\r\nBlack tea leaves have undergone fermentation, thus removing many nutritious nutrients.\r\nThings to consider when brewing the perfect green tea.\r\n\r\nGreen tea leaf type:\r\n\r\nThe bigger the green tea leaves, the longer it will take to brew.\r\nIt is better to use green tea leaves that are not wrapped in a tea bag, because the tea bag inhibits the release of nutrients into the water.\r\n\r\nStorage:\r\n\r\nUse a clean and airtight container (so the nutrients remain intact) to store green tea leaves in a place that does not get sunlight. Buy a little green tea leaves to keep it fresh.\r\n\r\nBrewing:\r\n\r\nGreen tea is served without sugar and milk. Too long brewing green tea leaves will cause a bitter taste. Temperature that is too hot when brewing green tea leaves will cause loss of nutrients.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the water is lukewarm, the catechins will not dissolve in steeping water. The water temperature for brewing green tea leaves is around 160 Â° F (71,11 Â° C). One teaspoon of green tea leaves is enough to brew a cup of green tea.\r\n\r\nHow to brew green tea:\r\n\r\nBring a cup of water to a boil and then let cool for one minute.\r\nAdd one teaspoon of green tea leaves and leave for 2-3 minutes.\r\nStrain and enjoy a cup of green tea.\r\nHoney can also be added.\r\n\r\nDrinking your green tea at the right time is as important as making it.\r\n\r\nHere are some instructions:\r\n\r\nNever drink green tea in the morning when the stomach is empty even though for the purpose of losing weight. Caffeine can cause the body to lack fluids (dehydration).\r\nGreen tea should not be taken when eating because it will reduce absorption of nutrients.\r\nDon\'t drink green tea mixed with milk, because the benefits of green tea will decrease and calcium absorption will decrease.\r\nThe best time to drink green tea is 11.00 or 16.00 to give maximum benefits to the body.', 20000, '2019-04-15 07:06:48');

Each region has a unique cuisine that other regions do not have, for example mixed rice. As the name implies, nasi campur is rice served with a variety of side dishes which number more than three types. There are many variants of mixed rice available in Indonesia such as Tegal\'s typical rice warteg, Yogyakarta\'s traditional gudeg rice, and Balinese mixed rice which is very popular in foreign countries. Like other traditional culinary, nasi campur Bali has a Balinese side dish that is different from other regional cuisines. For those of you who really like to eat mixed rice Bali, there are five side dishes that are always present and never absent, namely:\r\n\r\n \r\n1. Jukut Urap\r\nIn any mixed rice in Indonesia there are always vegetables in it, not least in mixed Balinese rice. Jakut urap is a food made from vegetables such as long beans, bean sprouts, cabbage leaves, spinach, long beans, and grated coconut with fried onion spices, garlic, citrus leaves, salt, shrimp paste, and chili so that it feels spicy . All ingredients are stirred together so that the taste becomes more delicious.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Sate Lilit\r\nSate lilit is a Balinese satay made from finely chopped fish meat and seasoned with spices such as garlic, onion, orange leaves, galangal, coriander, turmeric, chili, and thick coconut milk to create a savory flavor. There is something unique about this Balinese satay, which is a stick that uses lemongrass sticks so the aroma is very fragrant when burned. Besides using fish meat, satay lilit can also be made from chicken and pork.\r\n\r\n3. Sambal Matah\r\nSambal cannot be released from Indonesian society. When eating rice, chili sauce seems to be the right partner. Sambal matah is a sambal which is different from other Indonesian chili because it is not crushed or mashed. You can simply slice with finely made ingredients such as onion, garlic, cayenne pepper, lemongrass sticks, and kaffir lime leaves. After all the ingredients are finely sliced, mix with lime juice, cooking oil, salt, and grilled shrimp paste.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4. Shredded Chicken\r\nAlthough betutu chicken is the most famous Balinese chicken culinary, shredded chicken is the culinary that most often appears on Balinese mixed rice dishes. Shredded chicken made from boiled chicken breast and then shredded and given various spices such as lemongrass, bay leaves, orange leaves, red onion, garlic, cayenne pepper, shrimp paste, kencur, turmeric, and coconut milk. The taste is definitely savory spicy typical of Bali.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5. Teri Kacang\r\nFinally, there are anchovy nuts that add rich texture to mixed rice. Teri kacang is made from peanuts and anchovies that are already fried first and then given spicy seasoning. The crispy and crispy anchovy texture can replace crackers which are often used as additional side dishes for Indonesian dishes.', 12000, '2019-04-15 10:37:45'),
